 A Document digitization system designed specifically for the legal sector, capable of converting scanned legal documents into searchable, structured digital formats using computer vision, Optical Character Recognition and error correction techniques.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system automates the digitization of legal documents through a sophisticated pipeline that includes document preprocessing, text region detection, OCR, domain-specific error correction, and named entity recognition. The processed data is stored in a structured database, making it easily accessible and searchable.

### Key Features

- **Intelligent Document Preprocessing**
  - Automatic deskewing and rotation correction
  - Advanced binarization for enhanced text clarity
  - Optimized image enhancement for better OCR results

- **Custom YOLOv8-based Text Region Detection**
  - Trained on legal documents for specific layout understanding
  - Detection of four key elements:
    - Text blocks
    - Tables
    - Stamps
    - Signatures

- **Advanced OCR Pipeline**
  - Region-specific text extraction using YOLO detections.
  - Legal domain-specific error correction
